    "content": "An old lady and an old man lived in a little house by themselves they had no children and they felt very lonely and sad at times. It gets so boring with just the two of us you are always out in the garden and I have nothing to do after i finish my cooking and cleaning. Well I'm sure you can find some other ways to keep yourself occupied. Hmm i think i will bake something today, I haven't done that in a long time. That's a good idea go ahead and do that. Make something interesting for dinner tonight.\n\nnow I have to head out to the garden again as there are still some more weeds to be pulled out. The old lady decided she would make some gingerbread she got out all of the ingredients she needed and kneaded the dough for the gingerbread softly humming to herself, Suddenly she had an idea. let me do something fun i will make the gingerbread in the shape of a man a gingerbread man, my husband will be very amused I'm sure. So the old lady rolled out the dough and cut it out in the shape of a man\n\nlet me see now, one little ball to be shaped into a mouth two little chocolate chips for eyes and these pretty red cherries for buttons. Oh that's one handsome gingerbread man. I'm sure he'll taste as good as he looks, now into the oven. The old lady went sat on her rocking chair knitting away while waiting for the gingerbread man to bake. Hmm I'm starting to get the lovely smell of gingerbread must be done by now, let me go and check. The old lady put on your oven gloves and went to open the oven door.\n\nBut as she did the gingerbread man got up from the baking tray and jumped out of the oven. Good heavens, what was that? Before she realized what was happening the gingerbread man ran to the open window jumped out and in a second was running down the garden and out into the stream. Hey hey, where do you think you're going? come right back here, we are supposed to be having you for dinner. Oh no no I am not your dinner, for you can't lay your hands on me. run ran as fast as you can can't catch me, am a  gingerbread man!\n\nThe old lady's husband looked in surprise and his wife running after a gingerbread man. what's happening? Stop staring and run and catch that rogue. I had baked him for our dinner, but how did he run out? I will tell you all that later. Quick catch him before he vanishes. The old man starts running after the gingerbread man shouting at him to stop. The old lady cannot catch me, nor can you. Run run as fast as you can, you can't catch me, I'm a gingerbread man. Down the road ran the gingerbread man with the old man and the lady running behind him.\n\nA cow sitting beside the road saw the gingerbread man and said you look so tasty I want to eat you. The old lady and old man cannot catch me see if you can catch me, you fat thing. Fat thing, you cheeky fellow, just you wait till I catch you. The cow started running after the gingerbread man along with the old man and the old lady. Run, run as fast as you can you can't catch me I'm the gingerbread man. Along the road, they ran, with all the passerby's looking at them in surprise. A little way ahead a horse that was trotting along the road stopped to see what was happening.\n\nThat sure looks like a tasty meal. Everyone out of my way I'm going to catch that fellow and have him for dinner instead of hay. Ho Ho so you also want to eat me come on you can also try but you'll have to start galloping instead of trying believe me, you will be having your hay only for dinner after all so the horse also join the old lady old man and the cow to try and catch the gingerbread man The gingerbread man was having a lot of fun seeing all of them trying to catch him A little way ahead he stood by the roadside\n\nDon't you think you should give up let me tell you again run run as fast as you can you can't catch me I'm the gingerbread man Once again the gingerbread man started running looking back at all those chasing him with a big grin on his face A little way ahead was a big fat pig walking along with its piglets when it saw the gingerbread man it said That nice sure smells good should be a good treat for my little piggies wait wait I want to have a word with you no, you don't you want to make a meal of me that is not going to happen you stinking thing\n\nwhat how dare you rude fellow i will show you come on piggies let's catch him and eat him and so the pig and piglets also joined the rest to try and catch the gingerbread man up ahead there was a farm and near the fence was a big brown hen when she saw the gingerbread man she said you look so yummy may I have a nibble? May I have a nibble? no, you may not but you can always try Come, join the merry procession. Run, run, as fast as you can you can’t catch me, I’m the gingerbread man. oh what a sight it was there was the old man and the old lady trundling along\n\nThe cow and the pig waddling along the horse galloping along and the hen running and flapping her wings with a loud sound I think I’ve had enough fun. No way are those slow coaches going to catch up with me just look around for some place to rest running has really tired me out a little farther away there was a river flowing gently The gingerbread man wanted to go across to the other side but if he fell in the water he would become all soggy as he was thinking of what to do he heard a voice want me to take you across?\n\nthe gingerbread man looked around and saw a fox sitting against a rock you think I'm a fool you also want to eat me like the rest of them Eat you? a measly-looking fellow like you? you are not even enough as a starter, forget a whole meal! the fox was a very very wily fellow he knew the gingerbread man could run very fast and he was too lazy to run after him and why would you want to be so good to me i am not being good to you I was going across the river anyway so I thought you could hop on my back and I would take you across\n\ndecide fast i don't have the whole day okay what would you want in exchange I'll tell you that when we cross over come on on my back when they were halfway across the fox told the gingerbread man I'm feeling a bit uncomfortable i think it would be better if you put yourself on my neck the gingerbread man crawled onto the fox's neck ah that's better after a while, the fox started moving its neck and told him oh my neck has started paining and I think it would be better if you sit on my snout\n\nthe gingerbread man thought he was very smart but he couldn't guess what was going on in the cunning Fox's mind as before it did what the fox told him to There!  Are you okay now? this was the chance the Fox had been waiting for as soon as the gingerbread man sat on it's snout the fox quickly tossed him up and caught him in his mouth as he fell and there ended the tale of the gingerbread man Thought he was smarter than me!\n",

planned the mouse started to climb up the lion's tail he got up on the lion's back with a very confident look on his face he posed to his friends although he was very scared he was doing everything in his hand not to make it obvious right at that moment the lion woke up and as he shook his bow the mouse fell off [Music] the mouse and the lion came eye to eye [Music] [Applause] all the other animals

you give me one good reason as to why i shouldn't eat you your help will be returned i promise maybe one day i will help you as soon as the mouse finished what he had to say the lion roared in such a way how can such a tiny mouse as yourself be of any help to me but seeing the tiny mouse shaking in front of him the lion decided not to eat him thank god i am for now get out of my sight the mouse ran and got away from there watching all that was happening from\n\nafar the friends of the mouse were really surprised some time had passed by client got hungry and started wandering around in the forest but he could not notice the hunter's trap and got caught he was hung in the air in a big net he tried to break free from the net but he could not do it he was the king of the forest so if he could yell for help he would be humiliated and all the hunters would hear him and come to get him faster being out of options he began to wait meanwhile the other animals living in\n\nthe forest noticed the lion but nobody could dare get close to him when he was passing by little mouse saw the lion and he decided to help him he went directly next to him he started to climb the lines long tail

moment a shifty fox appeared from behind a tree i know how to swim if you want i can help you the gingerbread man thought about it what if you eat me you don't have to worry i don't want to eat you i just want to help you get across the gingerbread man trusted the shifty fox and jumped on his tail holding on as tight as he could the fox jumped in the river and began to swim meanwhile the old lady cow pig and the chicken came to the edge of the river\n\nand saw the gingerbread man crossing the river on the back of a fox helplessly they watched them go knowing they could not catch him anymore the river began to get deeper and the water started to hey fox keep your tail up i almost got wet up on my back it's safer the gingerbread man hopped on the fox's back they swam for a while but as the water got deeper the fox's back began to sink in the water i'm afraid that you'll get wet why don't you jump on my head where it's a bit higher\n\nthe gingerbread man climbed up on his head the fox continued to pursue his plan and dipped his head down in the water the water has risen too much why don't you get on my nose it's higher so the gingerbread man got on top of his nose right when they were about to reach the shore the fox tipped his nose flipping the gingerbread man into the air and opened his mouth the gingerbread man was going to fall into his mouth and the fox was going to eat him but it didn't work while the gingerbread\n\nman was in the air a crow flying right above them caught the gingerbread man with his beak the fox just stood there looking with his mouth open the gingerbread man waited for the crow to fly a little further and asked do crows eat ginger cookies yep when the crow opened his beak to speak the gingerbread man fell down and began to run as fast as he could yeah run run as fast as you can an old lady a cow a pig a chicken a fox and a crow also trying to catch me but nobody can because i'm the gingerbread man\n\nthe gingerbread man kept on running and did not stop [Music] if you see a gingerbread man pass you by running do not try to catch him because he is the gingerbread man and nobody can dare catch [Music]\n",

    "content": "[Music] once upon a time they lived three piglets with their mother in a small house it was time for them to leave their home and learn to live on their own their mother called the three piglets next to her my dear children the time has come for you to go out into the world go and start your new lives but don't ever forget whatever you do in this world do the best you can this is the only and the best way to stay alive a little sad with a bit of excitement the three little piglets said their\n\ngoodbyes to their mummy and were on their way after a while they found some piece of land where they could build their own home [Music] the youngest piglet was determined to build his home with straw he thought this was the easiest and the fastest way to build a home that way he had heaps of time to play the youngest of them all finished his house in one day he yelled out to the other piglets hey you guys i'm already finished the eldest piglet had a look at the house okay but this house doesn't look steady\n\nat all how will we protect ourselves from the wolf the youngest piglet didn't take any notice of his brother don't worry nothing will happen okay don't say i didn't warn you the middle piglet decided to make his house out of wood from the branches he had collected in the woods he decided to build a little cubby house his house took exactly three days to finish this house was a bit more steady than the one with straw the eldest piglet walked over towards him am i dear brother you've done a great\n\njob but this doesn't look safe at all is this house going to protect us from the wolf the middle piglet answered don't worry this house is very safe okay don't say i didn't want you while the two little piglets were having a great time in their newly built homes the eldest of them all was constantly working because he was building a home from bricks and rocks the other piglets thought that his effort was useless all they did was play around and kill time why would you bother with this when you\n\ncan quickly finish like we have hey how how's gary they the eldest piglet didn't bother listening to them he worked for one whole week and managed to finish his house made out of bricks and rocks a day later a hungry wolf arrived near their home he first stood in front of the house made of straw the little piglet was resting in his house made of straw the wolf knocked on the door [Music] open the door and let me in if you don't i'll huff and puff and blow your house in you can't do anything to me my house is\n\nsteady enough and so the wolf huffed and puffed and he blew his house in but with great effort the little piglet managed to get away and off he ran over to his brother's house made from tree branches he knocked on the door and when the middle piglet opened the door the little piglet threw himself inside the house i close the door the wolf can come in here don't worry he can't do anything to us in this house after a while the wolf came by the second piglet's wooden house and yelled\n\ninside open the door and let me in if you don't i'll huff and puff and blow your house in you can't blow my house in and so the wolf huffed and puffed and he blew his house in and brought it down both piglets ran to the third piglet's house and barely got away from the wolf brother the woman's going this way what are we going to the oldest piglet answered very sure of himself don't worry the wolf cannot come in this house a little later the starving wolf came by the third piglet house of bricks and\n\nstone and yelled to the three piglets open the door and let me in if you don't i'll huff and puff and blow your house in don't you even try you bad wolf you cannot come in this house the wolf got very angry he huffed and puffed but nothing happened he could not bring his house down he tried and tried but he couldn't move one single brick finally being exhausted the wolf decided to try another way to go in he saw the chimney up on the roof and started to climb realizing that the wolf was going to\n\nclimb up on the roof and come down the chimney the piglet quickly lit up the fireplace right under the chimney and put a big bucket of water on the woods the wolf barely climbed up the chimney and threw himself in [Music] and went straight into the boiling bucket oh help help burning save help finally being free from the wolf the piglets hugged each other with joy the three piglets went to their mother's house the next day to tell her all that had happened the youngest one came next to his mother\n\nyou were right mummy whatever we did in this world we have done it to our best if you really work for something it will be a success from that day on the two piglets were never lazy they worked hard like their big brother and lived a happy and safe life [Applause] once upon a time there lived a little girl this girl wore a red riding hood at all times that's why everybody used to call her little red riding hood darling yes mommy [Music] you know your grandmother is ill would you take her the cookies i baked and the\n\nfresh herbs i picked from the woods of course mummy i will the little girl with her red riding hood as always started her journey to her grandmother's house do not leave the road in the bunny forest sweetheart said her mother as she was leaving little red riding hood started walking in the forest while joyously singing songs [Music] i wonder why they call it the bunny forest i haven't seen any bunnies along the way little red riding hood came to a road filled with flowers there were all kinds of coloured flowers\n\ni should pick some flowers for my grandmother she'll be very pleased while little red riding hood was picking the flowers she did not realize that she was drifting away from her path at that moment she had a sound coming from the bushes [Music] suddenly a big bad wolf approached in front of her little red riding hood was so scared that when she saw the wolf right in front of her eyes she dropped the basket that she was carrying the wolf jumped closer to her and collected the cookies she had dropped\n\nfrom the basket and gave them back to little red riding hood little red riding hood was amazed by this unexpected gesture from the wolf thank you where are you heading little girl to my grandmother's house the yellow house at the end of this forest she is not feeling well so i'm bringing her cookies and healthy herbs really by the way you can call me little red riding hood like everybody else does i'll head on first and let your grandmother know that you're on your way so that you can continue picking up your\n\nbeautiful flowers right at that moment he heard a gunshot of an approaching hunter's rifle and ran away as fast as he could little red riding hood looked around for a moment and started crying realizing that she was lost hearing her crying the hunter approached and came next to her [Music] what are you doing alone here little girl it's very dangerous around here i'm looking for a big bad wolf whom i've been hunting for a very long time little red riding hood was very ashamed because she had not listened to her\n\nmother and left the road in the bunny forest so she could not tell the hunter that she had met the wolf um well i was bringing cookies to my ill grandmother living at the end of the forest and i got lost let me bring you to your grandma's home then they started to walk together and right then the wolf took a shortcut and quickly made it to the grandmother's house he knocked on the door the grandmother yelled from inside who is it the wolf changing his voice it's me grandma little red riding hood\n\ni brought you cookies and fresh herbs from the woods the door is open my dear you can come in the wolf smirked and stormed in through the open door [Music] when a while later little red riding hood and the hunter arrived at the grandmother's house [Music] go little girl go next to your grandmother as soon as possible the hunter went back on his way little red riding hood knocked on the door her grandmother yelled from inside who is it it's me grandma little red riding hood the door is open my darling\n\nyou can't come in little red riding hood hesitated for a moment because the sound she heard did sound a little different than her grandmother she then remembered that her grandmother was ill a grandmother probably sounds like that because she is ill little red riding hood opened the door and went in [Music] the wolf dressed in grandmother's clothing with her night cap and her glasses was lying in the bed he also closed the drape so that it became dark inside and little red riding hood could not recognize him\n\ni thank you darling for all your trouble getting all the way here to bring me food come next to me so i can give you a hug come on darling come closer little red riding hood left the basket on the floor but she did not get too close to the bed because her grandma looked different [Music] why are your arms so long grandma so that i can hug you better hmm why are your ears so big so that i can hear you better but why are your eyes so huge so that i can see you better why are your teeth so sharp grandmother\n\nso that i can eat you better [Laughter] the wolf jumped out of the bed and charged at the little red riding hood [Applause] at that moment little red riding hood realized that it wasn't her grandmother lying in the bed but instead the big bad wolf she had ran into along the way the hunter heard little red riding hood scream [Music] help me and ran straight to the house stormed into the open door and caught the wolf immediately [Music] i finally got you big bad wolf now you're in my hands\n\nthe hunter cut the wolf's belly and rescued the grandmother thank you for saving us mr hunter you're welcome but promise me little girl that you will never forget what your mother asks of you [Music] with great appetite grandmother ate all the cookies little red riding hood had brought for her boil the healthy herbs to make a cup of tea and instantly got well [Music] little red riding hood promised her grandmother that she will never ever fall into the words of a bad wolf again little red riding hood was walking in\n\nthe forest once again singing a long merrily as she ran into the same wolf again the wolf was punished by the hunter to clean the forest and he was very ashamed about what he did when he saw the little red riding hood the bunny forest became full of joy bunnies and flowers like it was once before\n",

    "description": "A touching story about acceptance and self-discovery, following a duckling who endures hardship and bullying before realizing his true beauty and worth.",
    "content": "The Ugly Duckling On a beautiful summer day, a family of ducks is taking a swim while another is enjoying a stroll by the bank. But one duck is sitting on her eggs among the tall leaves. I wonder when my babies are going to come out. They are taking so long to hatch! It is so lonely, no one has the time to visit me. But Mommy duck didn’t have to wait too long. Soon the eggs started cracking and the little ducklings started taking small unsteady steps out of their shells. Quack quack, quack quack.\n\nOooh, my babies are so beautiful! Now come and line up here all of you. One..Two..Three..Four…Five..Hey, there should be one more. Mother duck looked around, and saw one egg which had not yet hatched I think I will have to sit again on this egg till it hatches. It seems pretty large. Soon the last egg hatched, but the duckling that crept out was large and ugly. This little fellow doesn’t look like his brothers and sisters. The next day, Mother Duck leads her brood to the water. Oh! I am proud today that my ducklings are swimming so well!\n\nAnd how well the youngest one is swimming. Come on kids, that’s enough for today. We must get to the farm before it turns dark. The duck family makes its way to the farmhouse, where there are lots of other ducks. What is that strange looking creature doing here? The other ducklings are so cute but this one is so big and ugly. He is ugly. We don’t want him here. That’s not a nice thing to say. He is still small, and I’m sure he will grow up to be beautiful too. But the other ducklings continued to bully and make fun of the ugly duckling.\n\nI hope the ducklings stop this nonsense. I can’t bear to see that poor child looking so sad. But as days went by, things started becoming worse for the ugly duckling. Wherever he went, everyone was mean to him. Have you ever seen anything uglier than this? Ugh!! Seeing this creature in the morning, my day will also be as ugly as he is. Ha..Ha…he seems to be getting uglier by the day. The Ugly Duckling just wanted to hide somewhere and cry. Even his brothers and sisters were rude to him. Mother Duck was very sad to see everyone treat the ugly ducking so badly.\n\nNobody wants to talk to me or play with me because I am ugly. I will run away from here. So the ugly duckling flew over the fence of the farmyard, and continued flying till he spotted a large moor. He decided to spend the night there. I am so tired. I think I will spend the night here. Next morning, the ugly duckling woke up to the sound of loud quacking. He opened his eyes and saw a flock of wild ducks. Who are you? What are you doing here? Can I please stay here for a while? I have nowhere to go.\n\nYou are ugly….Stay here, but don’t get in our way. The Ugly Duckling stayed on the moor for a few days. He felt lonely, but no one bullied him or hurt him because of his looks. One morning, the duckling heard a noise like a big bang. He lay still, too scared to move. When he finally lifted his head and looked around, all the other ducks had fled. The ugly duckling also fled from the moor as fast as it could. It flew as fast as its young wings would take him. However, suddenly there was thunder and lightning, scaring the little duckling.\n\nArrr. I am so wet and cold. That cottage there looks warm, maybe I can take shelter there. The cottage belonged to an old lady, who lived with her tomcat and hen who found the duckling the next morning. What is happening here? Why are you making so much noise? What is this we have here? Looks like a duck, though a very ugly one. I know what I will do. I will keep it with me and wait for it to lay eggs. Then I will have eggs from my hen and from this duck too. Ah, but I do hope this is a duck and not a drake.\n\nSo the ugly duckling stayed with the old lady in her cottage. But here also, the tomcat and the hen made its life so miserable! Hey you, don’t you get scared when you see your face in the mirror? Look at me my coat is so silky. Look at my whiskers, so long and beautiful. The mistress says my walk is so graceful. You are such a loser. You cannot even lay an egg! Look at my eggs, such lovely big and brown ones. The ugly duckling continued to be lonely. He would sit in front of the window looking at the small pond outside.\n\nHow I wish I could swim in that pond. It used to be so nice when I swam in the cool water back home. Are you mad? The mistress is not going to let you go. You have a safe house, what more do you want? Behave yourself and don’t anger the mistress, the cat, or even me. Want to swim, indeed! The ugly duckling felt very, very sad, wondering what to do. I know this place is safe, but I feel like a prisoner here, being punished by being not allowed to swim. I want to swim – I want to be free to swim and fly as I please.\n\nI have to escape from here somehow. So one night, the duckling quietly crept out of the cottage and went in search of a new home. Soon he found a beautiful lake where he could swim and dive. Ahhhhh! This is such a lovely place. It feels so good to swim after so long. I hope the other animals and birds here are friendly so I don’t have to move away from here also. But alas, here too the other animals did not want to be friends with the ugly duckling. Why does everybody keep avoiding me? Just because I am ugly, it doesn’t mean everyone has to be mean!\n\nNo one wants to play with me or even talk to me! So life continued in this miserable way for the ugly duckling. Soon, the seasons changed. Autumn set in, and the colour of the leaves changed from red to orange and then gold. Winter followed. The forest turned white, and a very cold wind set in. The dark clouds made the duckling feeling even more gloomy and sad so the duckling decided to go to the lakeside. And what a lovely sight he saw there! What are these beautiful birds? I don’t think I have seen them before.\n\nHow beautifully they spread their large wings! It looks like they are not flying but just gliding through the sky. Though the winter grew colder and colder, the duckling continued to swim despite the freezing water and then finally took refuge in some bushes. Finally, it was spring again. Plants started sprouting and the sun peeped down from the sky. The duckling was so happy that it was becoming warm again. Everything around me has become so beautiful. My wings have also become strong and I can now swim in the pond close by.\n\nSuddenly, the duckling once again saw the same beautiful birds that he had seen at the start of spring and quickly ran and hid behind some bushes. Those birds are so beautiful. I better not go near them, or they too will make fun of me. I am so scared that they might even kill me! I am so tired of being picked on by everybody, first the ducklings at the farm, my own brothers and sisters the hen and tomcat at the cottage, and everybody else. I wish I had never been born! The duckling went to a quiet spot on the lake where nobody could see him.\n\nHe was very, very sad, and big fat tears rolled down its face. Suddenly, the duckling saw its own reflection in the lake, and couldn’t believe its eyes! For staring at him in the clear water below was his own reflection, no longer a dark, grey bird, ugly and repulsive to look at. Instead, he had turned into a graceful and beautiful swan. The ugly duckling had transformed into a beautiful swan!! All the other swans came to greet the newcomer, and stroked his neck with their beaks. Finally, the ugly little thing was accepted and loved by his new friends, to whom he belonged,\n\nthe beautiful and graceful swans. A family with two children came to see the swans swimming. Look, there is a new one. Father, mother, come here, there is another swan. A new one has arrived. The new one is the most beautiful of all. Oh, he is so young and pretty! The swan did not know how to react to so much praise. He felt shy and tried to hide his face. After being mocked and taunted and bullied for so long, he couldn’t believe he was being appreciated and accepted! And he was actually being called beautiful!\n\nI never dreamt that I would see a day when someone would call me beautiful! I wish I had received the same love and affection when I was the little and ugly creature i wouldn’t have spent such a sad childhood. Why do people treat others according to their looks? That is so, so sad!\n\n",
